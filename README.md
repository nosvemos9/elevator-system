# Elevator Control System

This is a simulation of a basic elevator control algorithm written in Java. It determines which elevator should respond to a floor request based on current positions and call priorities.

## Features
- Multiple elevators
- Floor request prioritization
- Object-oriented structure

## Technologies
- Java
- Python

## Future Improvements
- Add GUI interface
- Add response time calculations
- Implement a user-aware elevator dispatching system
